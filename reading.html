  <h3>The Art of Choosing by Sheena Iyengar </h3>
  <a href="#">on Amazon</a>
  
  <p>Something
  <blockquote>In a study of infants as young as four month, researchers attached strings to the infants’ hands and let them learn that tugging the string, they could cause pleasant music to play. When the researchers later broke the association with the string, making the the music play at random intervals instead, the children became sad and angry, even though the experiment was designed so that they heard the same amount of music as when they had activated the music themselves. These children didn’t only want to hear the music; they craved the power to choose it.</blockquote>
